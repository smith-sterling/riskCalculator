This is far from perfect. I had the idea and wanted to code it up. Spent too long on it as it is for just a fun, personal project, and has so many logical errors and defects, and you can see a trail of bad logic behind me with the earlier versions. Maybe someone has already made a great one, and I could just look at that, but where'e the fun in that? We'll see where this goes. 

Also maybe note that in some of the little testing that I did, I also got the JVM to tell me it ran out of heap space, so don't try this with like 50 vs 50 yet. I need to work through that too, but maybe after I get smaller stuff working can we try to optimize stuff for space and speed...

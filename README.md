# RiskCalculator

This is a battle calculator for the game Risk.

This calculator makes the simplifying assumption that you will go until one country runs out of troops. In reality, you might have a bad run of luck and stop early, but this tells you the chances of you doing however well or poorly, assuming you won't stop.  

You can put numbers in that are obnoxiously large for normal risk games, and it's pretty fast for any reasonable numbers. Yay
